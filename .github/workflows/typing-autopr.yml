          title: "Add typing stubs (auto-generated)"
          body: |
            This PR adds auto-generated `.pyi` stubs under `typings/` using `stubgen`.

            - Helps mypy understand project APIs without touching runtime code.
            - Safe first step toward enabling blocking mypy checks.
            - You can iterate on these stubs or gradually add annotations in source.
