# Terminology alignment

Key terms used across the project (UI/README/API) and their definitions.

- **Plan**: core planning object that aggregates edits, executions, and artifacts.
- **Plan Version**: snapshot of a plan, identified by `version_id`.
- **Scenario**: logical bundle of input data (demand, inventory, policies, constraints, etc.).
- **Pipeline**: versioned processing DAG with stages such as `integrated`, `aggregate`, `allocate`, `mrp`, `reconcile`.
- **Run**: record of a simulation execution, identified by `run_id`. Each run references specific `config_version_id` and `scenario_id` values and may produce a `plan_version_id`.
- **Job**: unit of asynchronous execution (queued and monitored). Planning pipelines and simulations run as jobs.
- **Manual override**: user-driven adjustments to a plan. Current state resides in `PlanOverrideRow`; history is tracked in `PlanOverrideEventRow`.
- **Workspace**: working area on the plan detail page (`/ui/plans/{id}`).
- **Aggregate / Disaggregate / Schedule / Validate / Execute / Results**: tab names within the plan detail view.
- **Reconciliation**: process that resolves deltas between aggregate and detail plans (anchor/carryover).
- **Anchor policy**: strategy for aligning detail (DET) and aggregate (AGG) plans, e.g., `DET_near`, `AGG_far`, `blend`.
- **Carryover**: method for distributing boundary deltas to the preceding or following periods.
- **Window days**: adjustment window in days around the boundary.
- **Cutover date**: date marking the boundary between detail and aggregate planning horizons.
- **KPI**: key performance indicators such as fill rate, profit, capacity utilization, spill.
- **PSI simulation**: daily simulation balancing Production, Sales, and Inventory.
- **Nodes / links**: supply-chain network elements—nodes represent stores, warehouses, factories, materials; links represent transportation routes.
- **RunRegistry**: system that persists run history for comparison and reuse.
- **Multi-granularity reconciliation**: keeping aggregate (monthly/family) and detail (weekly/SKU) plans aligned under a single version.
- **Top-down allocation**: distributing aggregate plan values to detail levels.
- **Bottom-up rollup**: summing detail plan values back to aggregate levels.
- **Diff**: feature that displays deltas between plan versions or configuration versions.
- **Canonical configuration management**: system that stores validated configurations in a database, offering versioning, diffing, and import capabilities.
- **Canonical configuration**: standardized configuration data used by simulations and planning pipelines.
- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: structure defining component requirements and quantities for each product.
- **Capacity**: upper limit of production or transportation resources.
- **Service level**: ratio of demand satisfied; the complement of stockout rate.
- **Metrics**: operational metrics gathered via systems such as Prometheus.
- **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**: graph structure describing processing order in the planning pipeline.
- **Dry run**: execution that does not persist results or cause side effects.
- **Apply run**: execution that commits results to the system (counterpart to dry runs).
- **Diff preview**: visualization of expected impacts before applying plan changes.
- **SupplyChainSimulator**: engine that executes PSI simulations.
- **SimulationInput**: data model provided to `SupplyChainSimulator`.
- **Datasette**: tool for browsing SQLite databases via web UI.
- **Prometheus**: monitoring system and time-series database used to collect and visualize metrics.
- **OpenTelemetry**: open-source framework for collecting and exporting telemetry (metrics, logs, traces).
- **Application Database**: umbrella term for databases used by the app (ConfigDB, PlanDB, RunDB, etc.).
- **FastAPI layer**: API surface implemented with the FastAPI framework.
- **Docs (CSV / Metrics / Logs)**: exported CSVs, metrics, logs, and other artifacts produced by the system.
